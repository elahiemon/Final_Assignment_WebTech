<h1>Short Paragraph on Making an Omelette for All</h1>
<h3>(Short Paragraphs By Niamat Elahi Emon)</h3>
<p>Egg omelet is one of my most favorite food items. I would love to eat that very<br>often. Today I will tell you how to make an omelet. It is one of the easiest things<br>
to do in the kitchen and you can prepare some good food effortlessly. So let’s learn how<br>to make an omelet.</p>
<p>You need some salts, onions, two chilies, oil, and a pan where you have to fry it. Let’s talk about the steps.<br>
First of all, you have to break the egg on a little cup. And you have to mix some salt,<br>
onion, and chilies into them. Before that, you have to cut the chilies and onions properly.</p>
<p>If you want, you can add some water, if you are making two or three-egg omelets together. Turn on your stove,<br>
and place a clean frying pan there. Put some oil or butter there that you prefer. Wait a bit for the frying pan<br>
to become heated enough.</p>
<p>When the pan is ready, pour the mixer and wait until the downside gets well fried. And then take the upside down<br>
and wait for that to become well fried when both sides are fried, then your omelet is ready. See, it’s very easy<br>
to make an omelet.</p>
